/**

\mainpage XmlsJoiner Library
 
In some libraries it's common the usage of more than one Test Framework in order to test
different parts of the code. For example, in c++ code involving regular code with Qt GUIs you
could want to use GTests and QTests for testing different stuff. Besides the output XML files are
slightly different, it's impossible (or at least not trivial) to mix both XMLs in a single one
with the features provided by such frameworks.

This simple library has born for helping you to mix different tests-XML reports into a single file.
If you're a Continuous Integration fan, you've several xml's files and you want to join them in
order to be shown in single report, this library and the tools provided can help you.
